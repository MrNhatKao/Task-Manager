Task Management API
This project is a Task Management API built with Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, following the principles of Clean Architecture. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

Overview
This project aims to demonstrate how to build a scalable and maintainable API by applying the Clean Architecture pattern. Clean Architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular, testable, and adaptable to change.

Clean Architecture Implementation
Layers
The application is divided into several layers, each with a specific responsibility:

Core Layer: Contains the business entities and repository interfaces.
Business Layer: Contains the use cases (business logic) implementations.
Data Layer: Implements the repository interfaces for data persistence.
Presentation Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses (controllers and routes).
Middleware: Contains middleware functions for error handling and request processing.
Folder Structure
The folder structure is organized to reflect the Clean Architecture layers:

Note: This project follows the Clean Architecture pattern to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase. By separating concerns into different layers, we make it easier to manage changes, add new features, and test the application effectively.

Clean Architecture in This Project
This section provides a deeper explanation of how Clean Architecture principles are applied in this project.

Core Layer
Entities: The Task model represents the core business entity without any external dependencies.
Repository Interfaces: The TaskRepository interface defines the methods for data operations without specifying implementation details.
Business Layer
Use Cases: Contain the application's business logic, manipulating entities and interacting with repository interfaces.
Use Case Interfaces: Define contracts for use cases, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.
Data Layer
Repository Implementations: TaskRepositoryImpl provides concrete implementations of the repository interfaces, handling data persistence. In this case, an in-memory data store is used, but it can be replaced with any data source (e.g., a database) without affecting other layers.
Presentation Layer
Controllers: TaskController handles HTTP requests, invokes use cases, and returns responses.
Routes: Define API endpoints and map them to controller methods.
Middleware
Error Handling: Centralized error handling ensures that exceptions are caught and properly formatted responses are sent to the client.

By adhering to Clean Architecture principles, this project achieves:
Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a clear responsibility.
Independence of Frameworks: The core business logic is independent of external libraries and frameworks.
Testability: Layers can be tested in isolation with mock implementations.
Flexibility: It's easy to swap out implementations (e.g., changing the data layer from in-memory to a database) without affecting the core business logic.
How to Extend the Application

To adapt or extend this application:
Change Data Source: Implement the TaskRepository interface with a new data source (e.g., a database) and update the dependency injection in the routes.
Add New Features: Create new use cases in the business layer, define their interfaces, and implement them. Update controllers and routes as needed.
Enhance Validation: Add validation logic in controllers or middleware before invoking use cases.
